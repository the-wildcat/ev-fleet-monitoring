# EV Fleet Monitoring

Real-Time EV Fleet Monitoring and Predictive Analytics Solution, an Infosys Springboard
internship project being rebuilt module by module to production standards.

> **Status:** Phase 0 (foundation), Module 1 (authentication and roles) and Module 2 (EV
> registration and real-time monitoring) are complete. Modules 3–6 are in progress; see the
> roadmap below. Full documentation will be added in the delivery phase.

## Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env      # then edit values if needed
flask db upgrade                 # create/update the database tables
flask create-admin               # create the first administrator (prompts for details)
flask seed-vehicles              # optional: add 6 demo EVs driven by the simulator
flask run                        # open http://127.0.0.1:5000
pytest                           # run the test suite
ruff check .                     # lint
```

In Git Bash on Windows, activate with `source .venv/Scripts/activate`. On macOS/Linux, use
`source .venv/bin/activate`. In both, copy the env file with `cp .env.example .env`.

## Users and roles

| Role | How you get it | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| Driver | Default for every sign-up | View the vehicles assigned to them and their live data |
| Fleet Manager | Promoted by an admin | Whole fleet: vehicles, alerts, analytics, reports |
| Admin | `flask create-admin`, or promoted | Everything, plus user management (`/admin/users`) |

Sign-up requires email verification. Without SMTP settings in `.env`, the verification and
password-reset links are printed in the terminal running `flask run`. Other CLI commands:
`flask set-role <email> <admin|fleet_manager|driver>`.

Security measures: passwords hashed with scrypt; CSRF protection on every form; account lockout
after 5 failed logins (15 minutes); signed, expiring, single-use reset links; no account
enumeration through sign-up, login or reset; safe post-login redirects.

## Vehicles and real-time monitoring

Managers register EVs (make, model, registration number, battery size, efficiency, assigned
driver) and keep a service history for each. Every vehicle reports telemetry: location, speed,
battery charge (SoC), charging state, battery temperature and odometer. That data drives:

- **Live map** (`/monitoring/live`): all vehicles on OpenStreetMap, refreshed every 5 seconds,
  coloured by state (moving, idle, charging, offline) with low-battery warnings.
- **Vehicle page**: live figures, the last hour's route, and speed/battery charts.
- **Overview**: fleet totals (online, charging, average charge, low battery).

### Where telemetry comes from

| Source | When to use | How |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in simulator | No real devices (default) | Runs inside the web server. Vehicles marked "simulate" drive loops through Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata or Hyderabad, drain and recharge their batteries, and each has its own driving style. |
| Device API | Real telematics devices | `POST /api/v1/telemetry` with the vehicle's API key (shown once when the vehicle is registered). |

Simulator settings in `.env`: `SIMULATOR_ENABLED`, `SIMULATOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 5),
`SIMULATOR_TIME_SCALE` (default 12, so each 5 s tick simulates 1 minute of driving). To run it as
a separate process instead, set `SIMULATOR_ENABLED=false` and run `flask simulate`.

### Telemetry API

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/telemetry \
  -H "X-API-Key: evk_..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lat": 28.6139, "lon": 77.2090, "speed_kmh": 42.5, "soc_pct": 76.2,
       "is_charging": false, "battery_temp_c": 31.4, "odometer_km": 15234.7}'
```

Required: `lat`, `lon`, `speed_kmh`, `soc_pct`. Optional: `is_charging`, `battery_temp_c`,
`odometer_km`, `acceleration_mps2`, `power_kw`, `recorded_at` (ISO 8601; defaults to now).
Send up to 100 buffered readings as `{"readings": [...]}`; a batch is stored all-or-nothing.
Responses: `201 {"accepted": n}`; `400` with per-field errors; `401` bad key; `403` inactive vehicle.

Readings older than `TELEMETRY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7) are pruned automatically, or with
`flask prune-telemetry`.

## Project layout

```

  auth/         sign-up, email verification, login/logout, password reset, profile, roles
  admin/        user management for administrators
  vehicles/     EV registration, details, service history, device API keys
  monitoring/   live fleet map and its JSON feed
  api/          versioned JSON API for devices (/api/v1)
